# How to contribute:
1. Our bail fund list is in complete and limited to USA - this can be expanded easily.
2. Currently the app is using Twitter API, we would love to know if there might a need to an addinoal third-party service.
3. There are additional feature that yet we had the chance to develop, such as: sending location to the trusted friends, having the app works offline and so on.
